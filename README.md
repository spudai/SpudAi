## Hi there welcome to SpudAi if you want to download this file you will probabley find it flags up as containing a virus this is because modern virus scanners dont like the fact that it is a zipped package or the browser or system might flag it based on heuristics or ‚ÄúSmartScreen‚Äù reputation filtering. The upload was checked with Windows defender and no threats were found. The program uses networking functions and sockets which can also trigger virus software as these functions are also used in viruses and trojens. If you want help downloading the program or want any other help you can contact me at piet@raisystems.com
